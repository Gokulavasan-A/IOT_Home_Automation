# IOT_Home_Automation

Home Automation Project using NodeMCU, Alexa, and Arduino Cloud

Overview

  This project demonstrates a smart home automation system that integrates NodeMCU, Alexa, and Arduino Cloud to control        appliances. It allows users to manage devices using voice commands via Alexa or through a web dashboard, ensuring            convenience and energy efficiency.

Features

  1) Voice Control:  Control appliances with Alexa voice commands.
  2) Web-Based Dashboard: Monitor and control devices remotely via Arduino Cloud.
  3) Real-Time Updates: Appliance status updates synchronized across the cloud and Alexa.
  4) Wi-Fi Integration: Uses NodeMCU for seamless communication between devices and the cloud.

Technology Stack

  1) Hardware: NodeMCU ESP8266, Relays.
  2) Cloud Platform: Arduino Cloud for IoT.
  3) Software: Arduino IDE, Alexa app

How It Works

  1) Appliances are connected to a relay module controlled by NodeMCU.
  2) NodeMCU communicates with the Arduino Cloud to process commands and sync device states.
  3) Alexa sends voice commands to the Arduino Cloud, which are forwarded to the NodeMCU.
  4) The dashboard on Arduino Cloud provides a user-friendly interface for manual control and monitoring.

Achievements

  ->Won first place at the project expo in GOVERNMENT COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING ERODE, showcasing innovation and technical    implementation.
