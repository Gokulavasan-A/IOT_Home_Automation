# IOT_Home_Automation

Home Automation Project using NodeMCU, Alexa, and Arduino Cloud

#Overview
This project demonstrates a smart home automation system that integrates NodeMCU, Alexa, and Arduino Cloud to control appliances. It allows users to manage devices using voice commands via Alexa or through a web dashboard, ensuring convenience and energy efficiency.

#Features
  Voice Control:  Control appliances with Alexa voice commands.
  Web-Based Dashboard: Monitor and control devices remotely via Arduino Cloud.
  Real-Time Updates: Appliance status updates synchronized across the cloud and Alexa.
  Wi-Fi Integration: Uses NodeMCU for seamless communication between devices and the cloud.

#Technology Stack
  Hardware: NodeMCU ESP8266, Relays, Sensors (if applicable).
  Cloud Platform: Arduino Cloud for IoT.
  Software: Arduino IDE, Alexa app

#How It Works
  Appliances are connected to a relay module controlled by NodeMCU.
  NodeMCU communicates with the Arduino Cloud to process commands and sync device states.
  Alexa sends voice commands to the Arduino Cloud, which are forwarded to the NodeMCU.
  The dashboard on Arduino Cloud provides a user-friendly interface for manual control and monitoring.

#Achievements
  Won first place at the project expo in [Your College Name, Year/Date], showcasing innovation and technical implementation.
